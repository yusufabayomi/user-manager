# User Manager

The user manager is a demo app to illustrate an introduction to redux in performing CRUD operations. The app could have been equally built without redux but my intention is to give a simple demonstration to using redux to handle CRUD.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.

## Dependencies

    - redux
    - react-redux
    - redux-thunk
    - react-final-form (for form validation)
